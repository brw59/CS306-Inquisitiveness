# CS306-Inquisitiveness

Merge sort works

heap sort .cpp files currently do not

the .py program takes 1 command line argument of a number and generates a new 
file with the number of random numbers that is specified in the parameter, and 
also names the file accordingly.

the "Randomnm"#.txt files contain # number of random numbers between 1 and 50,000


There is a whole set of sorts from helfrichâ€™s class. However, not all of them work locally on your computer, while they do work in the linux lab

# Folder orginization
- main folder
   - `in/` folders that we run through our different sorts
   - `out/` the output of our files (times in CSV? operations?)
   - Otherwise: folders for the different sorts
   - In the main body of the folder there's a few python files to generate different data types
